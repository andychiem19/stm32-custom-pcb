#### Custom STM32 PCB
This project implements a custom STM32-based development board, designed as a personal learning platform for PCB design, schematic capture, and embedded hardware architecture.

**Tools Used**

`Altium Designer`
`STM32CubeIDE`
`Visual Studio Code`
`Git`

---

#### **Learning Objectives**

- Practice schematic capture and PCB layout using Altium Designer
- Apply best practices for power design, I/O breakout, and debugging interfaces
- Learn to read datasheets, select components, and prepare a board for manufacturing
- Build a foundation for future embedded firmware and system integration projects
